ZORK User Information

I. Getting a ZORK
 
    a. ITS:  Say ZORK^K to DDT rather than :ZORK to get a zork. 
    b. 10X/20X:  Invoke the local dungeon (usually ZORK.EXE)

II. Bugs, comments, suggestions...

    Always welcome and encouraged.  All mail should be sent to
    ZORK@MIT-DMS.  ZORK has a BUG command, in addition, which
    may be used to report strange happenings.  Its use is described
    below.  Please note that for 10X/20X systems, net mail to ZORK
    will be acted on much more quickly than BUG command reports.

    If, in making a bug report, you know what symptoms were exhibited
    by the program, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!!! include them.  It is at best
    extremely irritating and at worst useless to receive a bug report
    like 'mumble frotz' loses, or 'try saying \"mumble frotz\"'.  With
    such reports, we have no way of knowing the situation when your
    'mumble frotz' lost, and no way of knowing if any bug we manage
    to reproduce (if we do) is the same one you saw.  In consequence,
    everyone's time is wasted.

III. Typing to Zork.

    A number of characters in Zork have special effects.  These
    include a number of line editing commands.  The characters are:

     <rubout> or <backspace>:  delete the last character typed
     <ctrl-W>:  delete the last word typed
     <ctrl-U> or <ctrl-X> or <ctrl-@>:  delete the entire buffer
     <ctrl-D>:  redisplay the buffer
     <ctrl-L>:  redisplay the buffer.  Sometimes this also clears the
        screen.
     
     <altmode/cr>:  terminate commands
     <ctrl-S>:  flush long typeouts
     <ctrl-G>:  like the QUIT command (vide infra)
     <semicolon>:  Causes the remainder of the command line to be ignored.
        This may be useful for annotating hard copies/scripts of games.

IV.  Garbage Collection

    Zork may occasionally type out a message 'GIN FREE STORAGE-
    <long pause> GOUT TIME=10.92'.  This indicates that a garbage
    collection is occurring.  We have attempted to prevent this, since it
    may take a significant amount of real time on a loaded system; should
    it ever occur, please send mail to ZORK@MIT-DMS describing the
    circumstances -- how many moves have been made, whether a RESTORE has
    been done, and so on.  THIS IS NOT FATAL:  after the GOUT message is
    printed, you may continue playing.

V.  User Commands

    The following commands may prove useful for the playing of Zork.
They are not, however, game commands (i.e. they have no side effects
in the current game).

 a. Verbosity

   Verbose:      The default:  print long room descriptions on first
                 visit, 20% of the time thereafter.

   Brief:        Supresses printing of long room descriptions for rooms
                 which have been visited.  Short object descriptions
                 are also used in such rooms.
 
   Super(brief): Suppresses printing of all long descriptions, even
                 on the first visit.  Short object descriptions are
                 always used.

   Noobj:        Suppresses printing of object descriptions in rooms
                 already visited.  See the 'object' command.

Note that the maximally verbose description (that printed on the
first visit to a room in verbose mode) may always be obtained by
saying 'look'.  See also the 'room' and 'object' commands.

 b. Help
    
    Info:        Prints a file which might give some idea of
                 what the game is about.
     
    Help:        Prints a short summary of useful commands.

    Doc:         Prints this.

 c. Progress

    Quit:        Prints your score, and asks whether you wish to
                 continue playing.

    Score:       Deflate your ego.

    Time:        Describe how much of eternity you have injured.

    Versi(on):   Describe the current version.

 d. Hard copy (directory owners only!)

    Scrip(t):    Script to a file ZORK.SCRIPT 

    Unscr(ipt):  End scripting

 e. Save/restore  (directory owners only!)

    Save:        Save the game for future continuation (to ZORK.SAVE)

    Resto(re):   Restore a saved game (from ZORK.SAVE)
                 Only the player who created the save file can restore
                 it at a later time!  You are warned.
                
 f. Bugs, etc.

    Bug:         Although the best way to report bugs is to send mail
                 to ZORK@MIT-DMS, there is a 'bug' and command
                 built in to the game.  This generates files which 
                 must, alas, be manually transmitted to the
                 maintainers.  It is, however, better than nothing.
     
    Featu(re):   Like Bug, to make a suggestion for a feature.

 g. General

    Again:       Repeat the last input.

    Look:        Describe the current surroundings. 'L' is equivalent.

    Room:        Print the verbose description of the room, without
                 mentioning any objects.

    Rname:       Print the short description of the room.

    Object:      Print the verbose description of all the objects in
                 the room, without describing the room.  'Look' is
                 equivalent to a 'room' command followed by an
                 'object' command.

    Inven(t):    Describe your possessions. 'I' is equivalent.

    Diagn(ose):  Describe your state of health.

    Wait:        Causes 'time' to pass.

    Oops:        Corrects a misspelled word:  As an example,
                 for 'I don't know the word TORHC' -> say 'OOPS TORCH'.

VI.  Zork Command Parser
     
       A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return or
    altmode.  For reasons of simplicity all words are distinguished by
    their first five letters.  All others are ignored.  For example,
    typing 'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYLOPEDIA', while meaningless, is also
    creating excess finger motion.  Note also that ambiguities can be
    introduced by this:  'unscr' is 'UNSCRipt', not 'UNSCRew'.

       You are talking to a moderately stupid parser, which understands
    the following types of things.

 Actions:       

     Among the more obvious of these, TAKE, DROP, etc.  Fairly general
     forms of these may be used:  PICK UP, PUT DOWN, etc.

 Directions:

     NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
     Other more obscure directions (LAND, CLIMB) are appropriate in
     only certain situations.  Because words are only five letters,
     you must say 'nw' for 'northwest':  the latter is truncated to
     'north', which isn't quite what you had in mind.
     
 Objects: 

     Most objects have names, and can be referenced by them.  At most,
     two objects can be specified in one command.

 Adjectives:

     Some adjectives are understood and are required when there are
     two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.
     DOORs, BUTTONs)

 Prepositions:

     It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
     the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
     without.  Thus 'Give car to demon' will work, as will 'Give demon
     car.'  When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate:
     'Give car with demon' does not parse.

 Sentences:

     The parser understands a reasonable number of things.  Rather
     than listing them, we advise you to do reasonable things.  Note
     that several sentences may be typed on the same line, separated
     by periods or by 'and':  'n.e.s.w.open mailb and read' will [try
     to] do just that.

 Multiple Objects:

     Sentences of the following forms will parse:
        Put A and B and C in trophy case
        Put A, B, and C in trophy case
        Give A and B to the troll
     The following will not:
        Put A B in case
        Take A B C
     The point is that an AND or a <period> are required so as not
     to hopelessly confuse the parser.
     Special objects named 'everything' and 'valuables' exist; one
     may, for example, say 'take everything' and 'put valuables in
     trophy case'. 

 Multiple commands:

     Several commands may be included on a single line.  They must be
     separated by 'then' or '.'.  Thus:
        TAKE BOOK. N. DROP BOOK AND CANDLE
     is correct.  Note that the use of a comma between commands will
     cause the command line to be parsed incorrectly:  comma should
     only be used between multiple objects.

 Ambiguity:

     The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
     actions which require objects in the case that the object is not
     specified.  If there is only one possible object, the parser will
     assume that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
     Most questions asked by the parser can be answered (e.g. With
     what?).  
         
 Errors:        

     There are a number of errors which the parser may find in an input 
     sentence.  Some of the more common ones are listed here:

    1. 'I don't know the word ZROK'.  Probably the most common parser
        error.  To correct the spelling of a work, use the OOPS command.
        In this case, 'OOPS ZORK' would be the correct thing.

    2. 'I can't make sense out of that.'.  This error means that there
        is no known syntax that matches the input.  For example, saying
        'PUT X WITH Y' does not match any known form for the verb 'PUT'.
        This error never implies that the idea of the command was not
        good, but rather that the parser doesn't know that form of the
        verb.  It's usually best to try another way of saying the same
        thing.

    3. 'Huh?'.  A command usually without a noun or a verb.  Sometimes
        this is confusing, because a word thought to be a noun was really
        an adjective.  This is the case with, for example, 'GOLD'.
        Other commands which cause this are: 'WITH' and 'THE'.

    4. 'I can't see any <thing> here.'.  An object represented by
        'thing' was not found within the room or on your person.

    5. 'It's too dark in here to see.'.  A reference was made to
        an object within an unlighted room.

    6. 'I can't reach the <thing> from within the <vehicle>'.  This
        means that the <thing> referenced was within the room proper,
        while you are in a vehicle within that room.  Some vehicles
        will not allow access to objects outside of themselves.

    7. 'That doesn't make any sense.'  Usually this will mean that
        something like 'TAKE THE COIL OF KEYS' instead of the 'SET'
        of keys.  In the general case, 'THE <x> of <y>' is legal only
        if <x> and <y> are names for the same thing.

    8. 'Two verbs in command?'  The parser believes that two verbs
        were in the command.  If you check carefully, you will find
        that one of the words is really a verb, and not a noun as
        supposed.

    9. 'Double preposition?'  Try 'TAKE WITH IN MAILBOX'.

   10. 'Multiple inputs cannot be used with <verb>'.  It is only
        legal to use multiple inputs with certain verbs.  The ones
        which come to mind are TAKE, DROP, and PUT.

   11. 'Too many objects specified?'  A legal command may contain
        at most two object references.

   12. 'Beg pardon?'.  A null input was parsed.

VII.  Theories

     The following 'theories' are fundamental to the game and should
     be noted:

  Containment:  

      Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers
      can be opened and closed; the rest are always open.  They may or
      may not be transparent.  For you to access (take, for example)
      an object which is in a container, the container must be open;
      for you to see such an object, the container must either be open
      or transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have
      sizes; the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on
      their sizes.  You may "put" any object you have access to (it
      need not be in your hands) into any other object; at some point,
      the program will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have
      it, which process may fail if you're carrying too much.
      Although  containers can contain other containers, the program
      doesn't access more than one level down.

  Fighting:

      Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
      attacked; they may in some cases attack you unprovoked.  Useful
      verbs here are 'attack <villain> with <weapon>', 'kill', etc. 
      Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  The adventurer has a
      fighting strength, which varies with time:  in particular, being
      in a fight, getting killed, and getting injured, all lower it. 
      One's carrying capacity may also be reduced after a fight. 
      Strength is regained with time.  (Thus, it is not a good idea to
      fight someone immediately after being killed.)  Other details
      may become apparent in the course of a few melees.  The
      'diagnose' command describes your state of health.

  Vehicles:

      There are some objects in the labyrinth which are rumoured to have
      the ability to transport the fearless adventurer to mysterious
      regions which are inaccessible on foot.  Needless to say, the
      adventurer faces great personal peril as he encounters these     
      regions.  The 'vehicles' can usually be entered with the 'board'
      command, and can be exited with the 'disembark' command. 
     Commands to ZORK are simple sentences: <verb>, <verb> <object>,
and <verb> <object> <indirect object> are examples.  Only the first five
characters of a word are looked at.  Simple line editing commands include
<rubout> to delete the last character, <ctrl-U,X,or@> to delete the
entire buffer, and <ctrl-D> to redisplay the buffer.  Commands terminate
with <cr> or <altmode>.  Long typeouts can be flushed with <ctrl-S>.
     Some useful commands are:

<direction>     Walk in that direction.  Common directions
                are N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, U(p), and D(own)
L(ook)          Describe the surroundings.
I(nventory)     Describe your possessions.
Diagnose        Describe your state of health
Score           Print your score & number of moves
Q(uit)          Leave the game
Save/Restore    Directory owners only - save/restore state of game
Bug             Report a bug            
Info            Describe the goals of the game

Welcome to Zork!

    You are near a large underground labyrinth, which is reputed to
contain vast quantities of treasure.  Naturally, you wish to acquire
some of it. In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the
caverns; to receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in
the trophy case in the living room.
    
    In addition to valuables, the cave contains various objects which
may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich; you may need
sources of light, since caves are often dark, and weapons, since
dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading material
is scattered around as well; some of it is rumoured to be useful.

    To determine how successful you have been, there is a score kept.
When you find a valuable object (i.e., pick it up), you receive a
certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
it.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure safely to
the living room, and placing it in the trophy case.  In addition,
some particularly interesting rooms  have a value associated with
your entering them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
which you may do only twice.

    Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who likes
to wander around underground (he has never been seen by the light of
day).  He likes to take things; since he steals for pleasure rather than
profit, and is sadistic, he only takes things which you have seen.
Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste he may take
something which is worthless; from time to time, he examines his take
and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occasionally stop in
a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders through and rips
you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).

    Have Fun!

in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
     There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
     In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as
'The History of the Great Underground Empire,' 'The Lives of the
Twelve Flatheads,' 'The Wisdom of the Implementors,' and other
informative and inspiring works.
     On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground
Empire, showing points of interest, various troves of treasure, and
indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
     On a desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of
the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc. t %Treasury of Zork v  …… ×Y  x V×Z  z×[×\  | V¿ ×] ~  ,‚º–²0 ×^  ×_ ×`   ×a   ×b F  ×c¡  ×d ¡ V×e×f¡ V×g¡ F¡×h×i ¡

His broad shoulders and helmeted head loom high over your own puny

very life from your body.  There hangs from his belt a veritable
arsenal of deadly weapons: sword, mace, ball and chain, dagger,
lance, and trident. He speaks with a commanding voice:

northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. 
Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the
top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you
will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors
contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was
inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long
tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK is written
in MDL (alias MUDDLE).

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO
commands (most systems).

    Direct inquiries, comments, etc. by Net mail to ZORK@MIT-DMS.

hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat, so
it is rather uncomfortable standing here.

to float in the air.  He glows with an eldritch light.  In a barely
audible voice he says, "Begone, defiler!  Your presence upsets the
very balance of the System itself!"  With a sinister chuckle, he
raises his oaken staff, taps you on the head, and fades into the
gloom.  In his place appears a tastefully lettered sign reading:

                        DUNGEON CLOSED

At that instant, you disappear, and all your belongings clatter to
the ground.

•T%You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor is
open.
     As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
     In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
     Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
     The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a foot
above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole „ñ J ‚Éo„ñ V‚Ép „ñ V‚Éq‚Ér„ñ V‚És‚Ét„ñ V“‚Éu„ñ J ‚Év„ñ‚Éw‚Éx „ñ V‚Éy‚Éz„ñ%.„ñ%AUX„ñ   ‚É{„ñ" V‚É| „ñ$ V¶& „ñ& V‚É}‚É~„ñ( V‚É‚Ê „ñ* V’}‚Ê„ñ, J ‚Ê„ñ. J ‚Ê„ñ0 V‚Ê „ñ2 J  „ñ4  ‚Ê„ñ6 V‚Ê „ñ8 ‚Ê„ñ: V¤‚Ê„ñ< V(‚Ê	„ñ> V‚Ê

        YOU too can make BIG MONEY in the exciting field of
                      PAPER SHUFFLING!

Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says: "Before I took this course I used
to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best."

Mr. MARC had this to say: "Ten short days ago all I could look
forward to was a dead-end job as a doctor.  Now I have a promising
future and make really big Zorkmids."

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone.  But when
you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

                Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive
structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet
tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir
created behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an
area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand
feet.

  The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom can type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:

Oh ye who go about saying unto each:   "Hello sailor":
dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning.†¼H   †¼J Vƒ±% †¼L  

From the Introduction:

The brochure describes, for the edification of the prospective
student, the stringent but wide-ranging curriculum of MIT Tech.
Required courses are offered in Ambition, Distraction, Uglification
and Derision.  The Humanities are not slighted in this institution,
as the student may register for Reeling and Writhing, Mystery
(Ancient and Modern), Seaography, and Drawling (which includes
Stretching and Fainting in Coils).  Advanced students are expected to
learn Laughing and Grief.

"There appears before you a threatening figure clad all over in heavy
black armor.  His legs seem like the massive trunk of the oak tree.
His broad shoulders and helmeted head loom high over your own puny
frame and you realize that his powerful arms could easily crush the
very life from your body.  There hangs from his belt a veritable
arsenal of deadly weapons: sword, mace, ball and chain, dagger,
lance, and trident. He speaks with a commanding voice:

                     \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS \"

As he grabs you by the neck all grows dim about you.">

<PSETG FLUSHSTR2
"Suddenly, a sinister, wraithlike figure appears before you, seeming
to float in the air.  He glows with an eldritch light.  In a barely
audible voice he says, \"Begone, defiler!  Your presence upsets the
very balance of the System itself!\"  With a sinister chuckle, he
raises his oaken staff, taps you on the head, and fades into the
gloom.  In his place appears a tastefully lettered sign reading:

                        DUNGEON CLOSED

At that instant, you disappear, and all your belongings clatter to
the ground.
">

<PSETG END-HERALD-1
"Suddenly a sinister wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, \"I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork. You
have persisted through many trials and tests, and have overcome them
all, dispelling the darkness of ignorance and danger.  One such as
yourself is fit to join even the Implementers!\"  He then raises his
oaken staff, and chuckling, drifts away like a wisp of smoke, his
laughter fading in the distance.">

"The dungeon master is taken momentarily by surprise.  He dodges your
blow, and then, with a disappointed expression on his face, he raises
his staff, and traces a complicated pattern in the air.  As it
completes you crumble into dust.">

"The dungeon master, obviously pleased, says \"You are indeed a
master of lore. I am proud to be at your service.\"  The massive
wooden door swings open, and the master motions for you to enter.">

"The knock reverberates along the hall.  For a time it seems there
will be no answer.  Then you hear someone unlatching the small wooden
panel.  Through the bars of the great door, the wrinkled face of an
old man appears.  He gazes down at you and intones as follows:

     \"I am the Master of the Dungeon, whose task it is to insure
that none but the most scholarly and masterful adventurers are
admitted into the secret realms of the Dungeon.  To ascertain whether
you meet the stringent requirements laid down by the Great
Implementers, I will ask three questions which should be easy for one
of your reputed excellence to answer.  You have undoubtedly
discovered their answers during your travels through the Dungeon. 
Should you answer each of these questions correctly within five
attempts, then I am obliged to acknowledge your skill and daring and
admit you to these regions.

"This is a large east-west corridor which opens onto a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is ">

<PSETG PARAPET-DESC
"You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upward out of sight.  The pit itself is
of roughly dressed stone and circular in shape.  It is about two
hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat, so
it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are an
indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face of
the dial are numbers 'one' through 'eight'.  The indicator points to
the number '">

<PSETG WIN-TOTALLY
"     As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the Dungeon
Master himself materializes beside you, and says, \"Now that you have
solved all the mysteries of the Dungeon, it is time for you to assume
your rightly-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!\"  He taps you
lightly on the head with his staff, mumbling a few well-chosen spells,
and you feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For
a moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among
the treasure, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a
mist and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

"     This is a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
     There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
     In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as
'The History of the Great Underground Empire,' 'The Lives of the
Twelve Flatheads,' 'The Wisdom of the Implementors,' and other
informative and inspiring works.
     On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground
Empire, showing points of interest, various troves of treasure, and
indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
     On a desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company of
the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc."

"                       WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you
will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors
contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was
inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long
tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK is written
in MDL (alias MUDDLE).

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO
commands (most systems).

    Direct inquiries, comments, etc. by Net mail to ZORK@MIT-DMS.

Mr. TAA of Muddle, Mass. says: \"Before I took this course I used
to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best.\"

Mr. MARC had this to say: \"Ten short days ago all I could look
forward to was a dead-end job as a doctor.  Now I have a promising
future and make really big Zorkmids.\"

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone.  But when
you earn your MDL degree from MIT Tech your future will be brighter.

"\"                Guide Book to
                Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive
structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet
tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir
created behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an
area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand
feet.

  The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom can type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:
        1) You start your tour here in the Dam Lobby.

To Whom It May Concern:

     I regret to report that the rumours regarding treasure contained
in the chamber to which this passage leads have no basis in fact.
Should you nevertheless be sufficiently foolhardy to enter, it will
be quite impossible for you to exit.

"There appears before you a threatening figure clad all over in heavy
black armor.  His legs seem like the massive trunk of the oak tree.
His broad shoulders and helmeted head loom high over your own puny
frame and you realize that his powerful arms could easily crush the
very life from your body.  There hangs from his belt a veritable
arsenal of deadly weapons: sword, mace, ball and chain, dagger,
lance, and trident. He speaks with a commanding voice:

		     \"YOU SHALL NOT PASS \"

As he grabs you by the neck all grows dim about you.">

<PSETG FLUSHSTR2
"Suddenly, a sinister, wraithlike figure appears before you, seeming
to float in the air.  He glows with an eldritch light.  In a barely
audible voice he says, \"Begone, defiler!  Your presence upsets the
very balance of the System itself!\"  With a sinister chuckle, he
raises his oaken staff, taps you on the head, and fades into the
gloom.  In his place appears a tastefully lettered sign reading:

			DUNGEON CLOSED

At that instant, you disappear, and all your belongings clatter to
the ground.

voice he says, \"I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork. You
have persisted through many trials and tests, and have overcome them
all, dispelling the darkness of ignorance and danger.  One such as
yourself is fit to join even the Implementers!\"  He then raises his
oaken staff, and chuckling, drifts away like a wisp of smoke, his
laughter fading in the distance.">

hideous fate, can be heard.">

your feet trembles, and your legs nearly buckle beneath you.
The spirits cower at your unearthly power.">

<PSETG EXOR3
"Each word of the prayer reverberates through the hall in a deafening
confusion.  As the last word fades, a voice, loud and commanding,
speaks: 'Begone, fiends!'.  A heart-stopping scream fills the cavern, 
and the spirits, sensing a greater power, flee through the walls.">

shaken at your clumsy attempt, resume their hideous jeering.">

Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the sounds of

From the Introduction:

The brochure describes, for the edification of the prospective
student, the stringent but wide-ranging curriculum of MIT Tech.
Required courses are offered in Ambition, Distraction, Uglification
and Derision.  The Humanities are not slighted in this institution,
as the student may register for Reeling and Writhing, Mystery
(Ancient and Modern), Seaography, and Drawling (which includes
Stretching and Fainting in Coils).  Advanced students are expected to
learn Laughing and Grief.

"     This is a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
     There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
     In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes as
'The History of the Great Underground Empire,' 'The Lives of the
Twelve Flatheads,' 'The Wisdom of the Implementors,' and other
informative and inspiring works.
     On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Great Underground
Empire, showing points of interest, various troves of treasure, and

Oh ye who go about saying unto each:   \"Hello sailor\":
dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods?
Yea, verily, thou shalt be ground between two stones.
Shall the angry gods cast thy body into the whirlpool?
Surely, thy eye shall be put out with a sharp stick!
Even unto the ends of the earth shalt thou wander and
unto the land of the dead shalt thou be sent at last.
Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning." )>

"			WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you
will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal
man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors
contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets
of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for
vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by
fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by
Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was
inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long
tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK is written
in MDL (alias MUDDLE).

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO
commands (most systems).

    Direct inquiries, comments, etc. by Net mail to ZORK@MIT-DMS.

to be a lowly bit twiddler.  Now with what I learned at MIT Tech
I feel really important and can obfuscate and confuse with the best.\"

Mr. MARC had this to say: \"Ten short days ago all I could look
forward to was a dead-end job as a doctor.  Now I have a promising
future and make really big Zorkmids.\"

MIT Tech can't promise these fantastic results to everyone.  But when

"\"		   Guide Book to
		Flood Control Dam #3

  Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783 of the
Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the
Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million
zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local
tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive
structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet
tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir
created behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an
area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand
feet.

  The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to
the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave
drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear
tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345
bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of whom can type),
12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape
processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  We will now point out some of the more interesting features
of FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:

"SPARSE -- set up parse vector.  This is done in two steps.
	In the first, each word of the input is looked up in the various
interesting oblists. If a DIRECTION is seen before an ACTION, the parse
wins.  Also, if any word is not found, the parse fails.  As various parts
of speech are found, variables are set up saying so
	In the second, the vector and variables resulting are checked.  Any
missing are (attempted to be) set up from the orphans of the last parse.
If they can't be new orphans are generated.
	There are three possible results of all this:  WIN, which means the
parse is done and no syntax checking is needed; the Parse-Vector, meaning
the parse needs to have syntax checking done; and a FALSE, meaning the parse
has failed."

of speech are found, variables are set up saying so

missing are (attempted to be) set up from the orphans of the last parse.
